When talking about signals, they can be broadly classified into analog signals and digital signals. All Digital Electronics like Logic Gates, Flip-Flops, Microcontroller, Microprocessor etc work with Digital Signals, while the Analog Electronics like Op-Amp, Power switches etc. In a typical electronics design, these two signals often have to be converted from one form to another. We already learnt how Analog to Digital Converters (ADC) is used to convert analog signals to digital value. In this article we will learn how Digital signals can be converted to Analog voltages using DACs.
