### Instrumentation Amplifier Basics and Applications

A special implementation of Operational Amplifiers is the Instrumentation Amplifier, a type of Differential Amplifier with Input Buffer Amplifier. In this tutorial, we will learn about few important Instrumentation Amplifier Basics and Applications and also the circuit and working of a three Op-amp Instrumentation Amplifier.

#### Introduction

Many industrial and consumer applications require the measurement and control of physical conditions. For example, measurements of temperature and humidity inside a diary plant to accurately maintain product quality, or precise control of the temperature of a plastic furnace to produce a particular grade of plastic, etc.

These changes in physical conditions must be converted to electrical quantities using transducers, and then amplified. Such amplifiers, which are used to amplify signals to measure physical quantities are commonly known as Instrumentation Amplifiers.

The input to an instrumentation amplifier is the output signal from the transducer. A transducer is a device which converts one form of energy into another. Most of the transducer outputs are of very low-level signals.

Hence, before the next stage, it is necessary to amplify the level of the signal, rejecting noise and the interference. The general single ended amplifiers are not suitable for such operations. For the rejection of noise, amplifiers must have high common-mode rejection ratio.

The special amplifier which is used for such low-level amplification with high CMRR, high input impedance to avoid loading is an Instrumentation Amplifier.

The instrumentation amplifier is intended for precise, low-level signal amplification where high input resistance, low noise and accurate closed-loop gain is required. Also, low power consumption, high slew rate and high common-mode rejection ratio are desirable for good performance.
