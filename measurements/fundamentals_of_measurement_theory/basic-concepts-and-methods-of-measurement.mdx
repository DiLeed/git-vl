Before you can use statistics to analyze a problem, you must convert the basic materials of the problem to data. That is, you must establish or adopt a system of assigning values, most often numbers, to the objects or concepts that are central to the problem under study. This is not an esoteric process, but something you do every day. For instance, when you buy something at the store, the price you pay is a measurement: it assigns a number to the amount of currency that you have exchanged for the goods received. Similarly, when you step on the bathroom scale in the morning, the number you see is a measurement of your body weight. Depending on where you live, this number may be expressed in either pounds or kilograms, but the principle of assigning a number to a physical quantity (weight) holds true in either case.

Not all data need be numeric. For instance, the categories male and female are commonly used in both science and in everyday life to classify people, and there is nothing inherently numeric in these categories. Similarly, we often speak of the colors of objects in broad classes such as “red” or “blue”: these categories of which represent a great simplification from the infinite variety of colors that exist in the world. This is such a common practice that we hardly give it a second thought.

How specific we want to be with these categories (for instance, is “garnet” a separate color from “red”? Should transgendered individuals be assigned to a separate category?) depends on the purpose at hand: a graphic artist may use many more mental categories for color than the average person, for instance. Similarly, the level of detail used in classification for a study depends on the purpose of the study and the importance of capturing the nuances of each variable.

#### Measurement
Measurement is the process of systematically assigning numbers to objects and their properties, to facilitate the use of mathematics in studying and describing objects and their relationships. Some types of measurement are fairly concrete: for instance, measuring a person’s weight in pounds or kilograms, or their height in feet and inches or in meters. Note that the particular system of measurement used is not as important as a consistent set of rules: we can easily convert measurement in kilograms to pounds, for instance. Although any system of units may seem arbitrary (try defending feet and inches to someone who grew up with the metric system!), as long as the system has a consistent relationship with the property being measured, we can use the results in calculations.

Measurement is not limited to physical qualities like height and weight. Tests to measure abstractions like intelligence and scholastic aptitude are commonly used in education and psychology, for instance: the field of psychometrics is largely concerned with the development and refinement of methods to test just such abstract qualities. Establishing that a particular measurement is meaningful is more difficult when it can’t be observed directly: while you can test the accuracy of a scale by comparing the results with those obtained from another scale known to be accurate, there is no simple way to know if a test of intelligence is accurate because there is no commonly agreed-upon way to measure the abstraction “intelligence.” To put it another way, we don’t know what someone’s actual intelligence is because there is no certain way to measure it, and in fact we may not even be sure what “intelligence” really is, a situation quite different from that of measuring a person’s height or weight. These issues are particularly relevant to the social sciences and education, where a great deal of research focuses on just such abstract concepts.

#### Levels of Measurement
Statisticians commonly distinguish four types or levels of measurement; the same terms may also be used to refer to data measured at each level. The levels of measurement differ both in terms of the meaning of the numbers and in the types of statistics that are appropriate for their analysis.

##### Nominal Data

With nominal data, as the name implies, the numbers function as a name or label and do not have numeric meaning. For instance, you might create a variable for gender, which takes the value 1 if the person is male and 0 if the person is female. The 0 and 1 have no numeric meaning but function simply as labels in the same way that you might record the values as “M” or “F.” There are two main reasons to choose numeric rather than text values to code nominal data: data is more easily processed by some computer systems as numbers, and using numbers bypasses some issues in data entry such as the conflict between upper- and lowercase letters (to a computer, “M” is a different value than “m,” but a person doing data entry may treat the two characters as equivalent). Nominal data is not limited to two categories: for instance, if you were studying the relationship between years of experience and salary in baseball players, you might classify the players according to their primary position by using the traditional system whereby 1 is assigned to pitchers, 2 to catchers, 3 to first basemen, and so on.

If you can’t decide whether data is nominal or some other level of measurement, ask yourself this question: do the numbers assigned to this data represent some quality such that a higher value indicates that the object has more of that quality than a lower value? For instance, is there some quality “gender” which men have more of than women? Clearly not, and the coding scheme would work as well if women were coded as 1 and men as 0. The same principle applies in the baseball example: there is no quality of “baseballness” of which outfielders have more than pitchers. The numbers are merely a convenient way to label subjects in the study, and the most important point is that every position is assigned a distinct value. Another name for nominal data is categorical data, referring to the fact that the measurements place objects into categories (male or female; catcher or first baseman) rather than measuring some intrinsic quality in them. Chapter 10 discusses methods of analysis appropriate for this type of data, and many techniques covered in Chapter 11, on nonparametric statistics, are also appropriate for categorical data.

When data can take on only two values, as in the male/female example, it may also be called binary data. This type of data is so common that special techniques have been developed to study it, including logistic regression (discussed in Chapter 15), which has applications in many fields. Many medical statistics such as the odds ratio and the risk ratio (discussed in Chapter 18) were developed to describe the relationship between two binary variables, because binary variables occur so frequently in medical research.

##### Ordinal Data

Ordinal data refers to data that has some meaningful order, so that higher values represent more of some characteristic than lower values. For instance, in medical practice burns are commonly described by their degree, which describes the amount of tissue damage caused by the burn. A first-degree burn is characterized by redness of the skin, minor pain, and damage to the epidermis only, while a second-degree burn includes blistering and involves the dermis, and a third-degree burn is characterized by charring of the skin and possibly destroyed nerve endings. These categories may be ranked in a logical order: first-degree burns are the least serious in terms of tissue damage, third-degree burns the most serious. However, there is no metric analogous to a ruler or scale to quantify how great the distance between categories is, nor is it possible to determine if the difference between first- and second-degree burns is the same as the difference between second- and third-degree burns.

Many ordinal scales involve ranks: for instance, candidates applying for a job may be ranked by the personnel department in order of desirability as a new hire. We could also rank the U.S. states in order of their population, geographic area, or federal tax revenue. The numbers used for measurement with ordinal data carry more meaning than those used in nominal data, and many statistical techniques have been developed to make full use of the information carried in the ordering, while not assuming any further properties of the scales. For instance, it is appropriate to calculate the median (central value) of ordinal data, but not the mean (which assumes interval data). Some of these techniques are discussed later in this chapter, and others are covered in Chapter 11.

##### Interval Data

Interval data has a meaningful order and also has the quality that equal intervals between measurements represent equal changes in the quantity of whatever is being measured. The most common example of interval data is the Fahrenheit temperature scale. If we describe temperature using the Fahrenheit scale, the difference between 10 degrees and 25 degrees (a difference of 15 degrees) represents the same amount of temperature change as the difference between 60 and 75 degrees. Addition and subtraction are appropriate with interval scales: a difference of 10 degrees represents the same amount over the entire scale of temperature. However, the Fahrenheit scale, like all interval scales, has no natural zero point, because 0 on the Fahrenheit scale does not represent an absence of temperature but simply a location relative to other temperatures. Multiplication and division are not appropriate with interval data: there is no mathematical sense in the statement that 80 degrees is twice as hot as 40 degrees. Interval scales are a rarity: in fact it’s difficult to think of another common example. For this reason, the term “interval data” is sometimes used to describe both interval and ratio data (discussed in the next section).

##### Ratio Data

Ratio data has all the qualities of interval data (natural order, equal intervals) plus a natural zero point. Many physical measurements are ratio data: for instance, height, weight, and age all qualify. So does income: you can certainly earn 0 dollars in a year, or have 0 dollars in your bank account. With ratio-level data, it is appropriate to multiply and divide as well as add and subtract: it makes sense to say that someone with $100 has twice as much money as someone with $50, or that a person who is 30 years old is 3 times as old as someone who is 10 years old.

It should be noted that very few psychological measurements (IQ, aptitude, etc.) are truly interval, and many are in fact ordinal (e.g., value placed on education, as indicated by a Likert scale). Nonetheless, you will sometimes see interval or ratio techniques applied to such data (for instance, the calculation of means, which involves division). While incorrect from a statistical point of view, sometimes you have to go with the conventions of your field, or at least be aware of them. To put it another way, part of learning statistics is learning what is commonly accepted in your chosen field of endeavor, which may be a separate issue from what is acceptable from a purely mathematical standpoint.

##### Continuous and Discrete Data

Another distinction often made is that between continuous and discrete data. Continuous data can take any value, or any value within a range. Most data measured by interval and ratio scales, other than that based on counting, is continuous: for instance, weight, height, distance, and income are all continuous.

In the course of data analysis and model building, researchers sometimes recode continuous data in categories or larger units. For instance, weight may be recorded in pounds but analyzed in 10-pound increments, or age recorded in years but analyzed in terms of the categories 0–17, 18–65, and over 65. From a statistical point of view, there is no absolute point when data become continuous or discrete for the purposes of using particular analytic techniques: if we record age in years, we are still imposing discrete categories on a continuous variable. Various rules of thumb have been proposed: for instance, some researchers say that when a variable has 10 or more categories (or alternately, 16 or more categories), it can safely be analyzed as continuous. This is another decision to be made on a case-by-case basis, informed by the usual standards and practices of your particular discipline and the type of analysis proposed.

Discrete data can only take on particular values, and has clear boundaries. As the old joke goes, you can have 2 children or 3 children, but not 2.37 children, so “number of children” is a discrete variable. In fact, any variable based on counting is discrete, whether you are counting the number of books purchased in a year or the number of prenatal care visits made during a pregnancy. Nominal data is also discrete, as are binary and rank-ordered data.

##### Operationalization

Beginners to a field often think that the difficulties of research rest primarily in statistical analysis, and focus their efforts on learning mathematical formulas and computer programming techniques in order to carry out statistical calculations. However, one major problem in research has very little to do with either mathematics or statistics, and everything to do with knowing your field of study and thinking carefully through practical problems. This is the problem of operationalization, which means the process of specifying how a concept will be defined and measured. Operationalization is a particular concern in the social sciences and education, but applies to other fields as well.

Operationalization is always necessary when a quality of interest cannot be measured directly. An obvious example is intelligence: there is no way to measure intelligence directly, so in the place of such a direct measurement we accept something that we can measure, such as the score on an IQ test. Similarly, there is no direct way to measure “disaster preparedness” for a city, but we can operationalize the concept by creating a checklist of tasks that should be performed and giving each city a “disaster preparedness” score based on the number of tasks completed and the quality or thoroughness of completion. For a third example, we may wish to measure the amount of physical activity performed by subjects in a study: if we do not have the capacity to directly monitor their exercise behavior, we may operationalize “amount of physical activity” as the amount indicated on a self-reported questionnaire or recorded in a diary.

Because many of the qualities studied in the social sciences are abstract, operationalization is a common topic of discussion in those fields. However, it is applicable to many other fields as well. For instance, the ultimate goals of the medical profession include reducing mortality (death) and reducing the burden of disease and suffering. Mortality is easily verified and quantified but is frequently too blunt an instrument to be useful, since it is a thankfully rare outcome for most diseases. “Burden of disease” and “suffering,” on the other hand, are concepts that could be used to define appropriate outcomes for many studies, but that have no direct means of measurement and must therefore be operationalized. Examples of operationalization of burden of disease include measurement of viral levels in the bloodstream for patients with AIDS and measurement of tumor size for people with cancer. Decreased levels of suffering or improved quality of life may be operationalized as higher self-reported health state, higher score on a survey instrument designed to measure quality of life, improved mood state as measured through a personal interview, or reduction in the amount of morphine requested.

Some argue that measurement of even physical quantities such as length require operationalization, because there are different ways to measure length (a ruler might be the appropriate instrument in some circumstances, a micrometer in others). However, the problem of operationalization is much greater in the human sciences, when the object or qualities of interest often cannot be measured directly.

##### Proxy Measurement

The term proxy measurement refers to the process of substituting one measurement for another. Although deciding on proxy measurements can be considered as a subclass of operationalization, we will consider it as a separate topic. The most common use of proxy measurement is that of substituting a measurement that is inexpensive and easily obtainable for a different measurement that would be more difficult or costly, if not impossible, to collect.

For a simple example of proxy measurement, consider some of the methods used by police officers to evaluate the sobriety of individuals while in the field. Lacking a portable medical lab, an officer can’t directly measure blood alcohol content to determine if a subject is legally drunk or not. So the officer relies on observation of signs associated with drunkenness, as well as some simple field tests that are believed to correlate well with blood alcohol content. Signs of alcohol intoxication include breath smelling of alcohol, slurred speech, and flushed skin. Field tests used to quickly evaluate alcohol intoxication generally require the subjects to perform tasks such as standing on one leg or tracking a moving object with their eyes. Neither the observed signs nor the performance measures are direct measures of inebriation, but they are quick and easy to administer in the field. Individuals suspected of drunkenness as evaluated by these proxy measures may then be subjected to more accurate testing of their blood alcohol content.

Another common (and sometimes controversial) use of proxy measurement are the various methods commonly used to evaluate the quality of health care provided by hospitals or physicians. Theoretically, it would be possible to get a direct measure of quality of care, for instance by directly observing the care provided and evaluating it in relationship to accepted standards (although that process would still be an operationalization of the abstract concept “quality of care”). However, implementing such a process would be prohibitively expensive as well as an invasion of the patients’ privacy. A solution commonly adopted is to measure processes that are assumed to reflect higher quality of care: for instance whether anti-tobacco counseling was offered in an office visit or whether appropriate medications were administered promptly after a patient was admitted to the hospital.

Proxy measurements are most useful if, in addition to being relatively easy to obtain, they are good indicators of the true focus of interest. For instance, if correct execution of prescribed processes of medical care for a particular treatment is closely related to good patient outcomes for that condition, and if poor or nonexistent execution of those processes is closely related to poor patient outcomes, then execution of these processes is a useful proxy for quality. If that close relationship does not exist, then the usefulness of measurements of those processes as a proxy for quality of care is less certain. There is no mathematical test that will tell you whether one measure is a good proxy for another, although computing statistics like correlations or chi-squares between the measures may help evaluate this issue. Like many measurement issues, choosing good proxy measurements is a matter of judgment informed by knowledge of the subject area, usual practices in the field, and common sense.
