The instruments used to measure any quantity are known as measuring instruments. If the instruments can measure the basic electrical quantities, such as voltage and current are known as basic measuring instruments.

Types of Basic Measuring Instruments
We can classify the basic measuring instruments into the following two types.

##### Voltmeters
Ammeters
Let us discuss about these two basic measuring instruments briefly.

##### Voltmeters
As the name suggests, voltmeter is a measuring instrument which measures the voltage across any two points of an electric circuit. The units of voltage are volt and the measuring instrument is meter. Hence, the word “voltmeter” is obtained by combining the two words “volt” and “meter”.

We can classify the voltmeters into the following two types based on the type of voltage that it can measure.

DC Voltmeters
AC Voltmeters
DC Voltmeter
As the name suggests, DC voltmeter measures the DC voltage across any two points of an electric circuit. A practical DC voltmeter is shown in below figure.
