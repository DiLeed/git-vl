#### What is feedback?

Feedback is a term that describes comparing the actual output of a system to the desired output and adjusting the actual output to produce the desired end result. For example, the human nervous system provides constant feedback to the brain, especially when pain is felt for avoiding further bodily harm.what-is-feedback-faq
